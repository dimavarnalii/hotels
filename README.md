# hotelzzz - site for booking hotels
If u need to open my project, u need to have Intellij IDEA
First what u need to do, fill out the registration form. After registration u need to confirm you are account on e-mail.
If u need add your hotel, u need to login as an administrator (login:admin pass:admin, after login as an administrator u need to press sign in) and grant your account rights "HotelAdmin"
If you have created a hotel in Lviv for 2 people, the same data should be entered in the search.
(If u log in as an admin u can "Block user", "Make hotel admin", "Make admin")
In this project i worked on Spring MVC, Spring security, JDBC, MySQL, Rest, Ajax, Bootstrap, Thymeleaf, CSS.

If u have some questions u can write to me:
